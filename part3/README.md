This project shows an example of ANT build file.

Launching the commands used to compile and run the application through the command line is not handy.

Ant allows the developer to describe the procedure to follow in order ti compile the application and, eventually, to run it.

Compiling the application:

    ant

Running the application:

    ant run

Cleaning the workplace:

    ant clean.
